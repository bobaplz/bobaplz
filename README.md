### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Curiosity seekers always stroll down the street and capture memorable moments while others cruise past in SUVs. I would like to describe myself as a curiosity seeker. My greatest satisfaction comes from exploring new findings, resolving problematic matters, and bringing creative ideas to the table with enthusiasm and confidence toward a future filled with joy, motivation, and success beyond my wildest universe.

Through my data-driven storytelling, data visualization skill, and presentations, I help the company and people find a brighter way so they do not miss out on the valuable opportunities within the market. Whether I am strategizing the product enhancement, measuring the potential risk, or speaking to audiences about the valuable story from the dataset, my goal is always the same: to help you find the small but powerful substance which can drive you to success so you can make your business or life more glowing.

Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I am always looking forward to an insightful conversation over coffee, or even better.
